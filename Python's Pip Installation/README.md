Pip generally comes out with Python. If It doesn't come, then you've to install it following [the official documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/).

After installation, you can run pip with this command: `python -m pip ...` without setting up pip. For using directly like this `pip ...`, you need to ensure that pip is added to your system's PATH: `C:\...\Python\Python312\Scripts` (where python installed)
